- 👋 Hi, I’m @d49k
- 👀 I’m interested in Stable Diffusion and other AI image tools.
- 🌱 I have no idea how to code, use github and all the lanuage is alien to me.
- 💞️ I don't know how to run Stable Diffusion on my PC at all, this is the only reason I'm trying to learn github.
- 📫 How to reach me: (Reddit: @d49k / Twitter: @d49kmj)
